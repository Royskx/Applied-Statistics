\begin{frame}{Why Applied Statistics Matters}
  \begin{block}{Real-World Applications}
    Statistics is essential across diverse fields:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Data Science} — Making sense of big data
      \item \textbf{Scientific Research} — Testing hypotheses and validating theories
      \item \textbf{Business Analytics} — Informed decision-making
      \item \textbf{Public Policy} — Evidence-based governance
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}

  \begin{block}{Course Philosophy}
    Bridge theory and practice • Emphasize interpretation over computation • Build intuition through visualization
  \end{block}

  \begin{block}{Learning with AI Tools}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item LLMs are powerful tools that can enhance your productivity
      \item Use them to \textbf{accelerate learning}, not replace understanding
      \item Always \textbf{verify results} and understand the underlying concepts
      \item The goal is to become a \textbf{better statistician}, not just faster
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}

  \begin{alertblock}{Remember}
    Deep understanding comes from practice, reflection, and making mistakes — not just from prompting!
  \end{alertblock}
